    <h2>Truthfulness Of A Young Boy</h2>
    <p>Abdul Qadir Jilani was an eminent Islamic scholar born in 11th Century CE,
      Persia.</p>

    <p>Early stories of Abdul Qadir Jilani describe him as a youth with a strong
      inclination for learning with a pious mother who encouraged her son to acquire
      knowledge. The following incident is narrated in a number of biographies of
      Abdul Qadir Jilani.</p>

    <p>At the age of eighteen he asked permission from his mother to travel to
      Baghdad to pursue his education. Baghdad then was the hub of political,
      commercial and cultural activity, and the center of world learning.</p>

    <p>On hearing this his mother was more than happy to send her son off to follow
      the path of higher scholarship. It was for such a purpose she had saved forty
      gold coins for Abdul Qadir. As she prepared supplies for his journey she sewed
      the coins into the lining of his coat for safekeeping.</p>

    <p>Before Abdul Qadir joined the caravan to travel to Baghdad, her parting
      advice to her son was, "Whenever you speak, speak the truth. Remember that the
      Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said, Truthfulness leads to righteousness and
      righteousness leads to Paradise... and the Quran tells us O you who believe!
      Be careful of your duty to God, and be with the truthful. (Quran 9:119)"</p>

    <p>In route to Baghdad the caravan was assaulted by a band of robbers. As the
      thugs began to extract all the valuables from the travelers, one of the
      robbers started to search Abdul Qadir's belongings.</p>

    <p>While searching, the robber asked Abdul Qadir, "Do you have anything
      valuable?'</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir calmly replied, "Yes."</p>

    <p>On hearing this the robber franticly searched further but could not find
      anything.</p>

    <p>The robber took Abdul Qadir to his leader and said, "This boy says he has
      valuables but I cannot find anything on him."</p>

    <p>The leader of the robbers asked Abdul Qadir, "Are you hiding any
      valuables?"</p>

    <p>Again Abdul Qadir answered, "Yes."</p>

    <p>The robber asked, "What are you hiding?"</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir replied, "Forty Gold Coins."</p>

    <p>Upon further searching the robber discovered the coins hidden in the lining
      of Abdul Qadir's coat.</p>

    <p>Among all the chaos and panic stricken travelers Abdul Qadir's unfrazzled
      demeanor and admitting the valuables he was hiding was perplexing to the
      robber.</p>

    <p>The robber was now curious to know more about this boy who was not afraid and
      insisted on speaking the truth.</p>

    <p>The robber asked, "What is your name and where do you come from?"</p>

    <p>He got a reply, "My name is Abdul Qadir and I come from the province of Jilan
      in Persia."</p>

    <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>"I am going to Baghdad."</p>

    <p>"What do you plan to do in Baghdad?"</p>

    <p>"I want to study with the greatest scholars to gain knowledge."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't you hide the truth and keep your gold coins safe from us?"</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir related the advice his mother gave him and the directive of the
      Prophet and the Quran to always speak the truth.</p>

    <p>On hearing this the robber was overcome with remorse and exclaimed to his
      companions, "This young boy is fearless and has an unshakable faith in God. He
      has the courage to stand up against people like us. Indeed his mother has
      taught him wisely and he is a true example of being a Muslim."</p>

    <p>Holding his head in shame, tears started to roll down his face. He embraced
      Abdul Qadir and asked for his forgiveness.</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir responded, "You only need to pray to God and ask for forgiveness
      and guidance. God willing you will amend your ways."</p>

    <p>On hearing this the leader of the robbers told his henchmen to return
      everything that was taken from the travelers. Then he cried out, "O God this
      young boy has shown us the straight path. Please forgive us and guide us to
      the right way."</p>

    <p>This is how a simple moral value of truthfulness thought by a mother to a
      young boy affected a band of robbers to change their lives.</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir Jilani went on to become a great scholar and teacher of Islamic
      jurisprudence.</p>

    <p>By Majd Arbil. The story is originally told in the book of Irsyadul 'Ibad by
      Shaykh Zainuddin bin Abdul' Aziz al-Malibari, quoting the story of al-Yafi'i,
      from Abu Abdillah Muhammad bin Muqatil, from Sheikh Abdul Qadir al-Jailani.

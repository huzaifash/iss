    <h2>Truthfulness of a Young Boy</h2><a
      name="truthfulness_of_a_young_boy"></a>

    <p>Abdul Qadir Jilani was an eminent Islamic scholar born in 11th Century
      CE, Persia.<p>

    <p>Early stories of Abdul Qadir Jilani describe him as a youth with a strong
      inclination for learning with a pious mother who encouraged her son to
      acquire knowledge. The following incident is narrated in a number of
      biographies of Abdul Qadir Jilani.</p>

    <p>At the age of eighteen he asked permission from his mother to travel to
      Baghdad to pursue his education. Baghdad then was the hub of political,
      commercial and cultural activity, and the center of world learning.</p>

    <p>On hearing this his mother was more than happy to send her son off to
      follow the path of higher scholarship. It was for such a purpose she had
      saved forty gold coins for Abdul Qadir. As she prepared supplies for his
      journey she sewed the coins into the lining of his coat for
      safekeeping.</p>

    <p>Before Abdul Qadir joined the caravan to travel to Baghdad, her parting
      advice to her son was, "Whenever you speak, speak the truth. Remember that
      the Prophet Muhammad (ﷺ) said, <q>Truthfulness leads to righteousness
        and righteousness leads to Paradise...</q> and the Quran tells us <q>O
        you who believe!  Be careful of your duty to God, and be with the
        truthful.</q> <cite>(Quran 9:119)</cite>"</p>

    <p>In route to Baghdad the caravan was assaulted by a band of robbers. As
      the thugs began to extract all the valuables from the travelers, one of
      the robbers started to search Abdul Qadir's belongings.</p>

    <p>While searching, the robber asked Abdul Qadir, "Do you have anything
      valuable?'</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir calmly replied, "Yes."</p>

    <p>On hearing this the robber franticly searched further but could not find
      anything.</p>

    <p>The robber took Abdul Qadir to his leader and said, "This boy says he has
      valuables but I cannot find anything on him."</p>

    <p>The leader of the robbers asked Abdul Qadir, "Are you hiding any
      valuables?"</p>

    <p>Again Abdul Qadir answered, "Yes."</p>

    <p>The robber asked, "What are you hiding?"</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir replied, "Forty Gold Coins."</p>

    <p>Upon further searching the robber discovered the coins hidden in the
      lining of Abdul Qadir's coat.</p>

    <p>Among all the chaos and panic stricken travelers Abdul Qadir's unfrazzled
      demeanor and admitting the valuables he was hiding was perplexing to the
      robber.</p>

    <p>The robber was now curious to know more about this boy who was not afraid
      and insisted on speaking the truth.</p>

    <p>The robber asked, "What is your name and where do you come from?"</p>

    <p>He got a reply, "My name is Abdul Qadir and I come from the province of
      Jilan in Persia."</p>

    <p>"Where are you going?"</p>

    <p>"I am going to Baghdad."</p>

    <p>"What do you plan to do in Baghdad?"</p>

    <p>"I want to study with the greatest scholars to gain knowledge."</p>

    <p>"Why didn't you hide the truth and keep your gold coins safe from
      us?"</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir related the advice his mother gave him and the directive of
      the Prophet and the Quran to always speak the truth.</p>

    <p>On hearing this the robber was overcome with remorse and exclaimed to his
      companions, "This young boy is fearless and has an unshakable faith in
      God. He has the courage to stand up against people like us. Indeed his
      mother has taught him wisely and he is a true example of being a
      Muslim."</p>

    <p>Holding his head in shame, tears started to roll down his face. He
      embraced Abdul Qadir and asked for his forgiveness.</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir responded, "You only need to pray to God and ask for
      forgiveness and guidance. God willing you will amend your ways."</p>

    <p>On hearing this the leader of the robbers told his henchmen to return
      everything that was taken from the travelers. Then he cried out, "O God
      this young boy has shown us the straight path. Please forgive us and guide
      us to the right way."</p>

    <p>This is how a simple moral value of truthfulness thought by a mother to a
      young boy affected a band of robbers to change their lives.</p>

    <p>Abdul Qadir Jilani went on to become a great scholar and teacher of
      Islamic jurisprudence.</p>

    <p>By Majd Arbil. The story is originally told in the book of Irsyadul 'Ibad
      by Shaykh Zainuddin bin Abdul' Aziz al-Malibari, quoting the story of
      al-Yafi'i, from Abu Abdillah Muhammad bin Muqatil, from Sheikh Abdul Qadir
      al-Jailani.  (Mahbib)</p>

    <h2>The King and Ministers with Three Bags</h2><a
      name="the_king_and_ministers_with_three_bags"></a>

    <p>Once a king called three of his most important ministers and gave each
      one of them a bag. He then told them to go around and fill up the bags
      with fruits.  This would test the sincerity of his ministers.</p>

    <p>The first minister took the order of the king seriously and worked hard
      to collect the best fruits he could find and filled up his bag.</p>

    <p>The second minister took the order of the king lightly and filled up his
      bag with a mixture of good and rotten fruits.</p>

    <p>The third minister did the totally opposite of both ministers. He filled
      up the bag with just dry leaves and dirt. His intention was to fool the
      king by just giving an impression that he had done his job filling the
      bag. He didn't have a single fruit in his bag.</p>

    <p>All three ministers came back to the court of the king with their bags.
      Without inquiring what they had collected, the king ordered that each
      minister must be sent to a separate jail for three months. The food they
      will be eating is what they had each collected in their bags.</p>

    <p>The first minister was happy as he had plenty of good quality food to
      live on. He wasn't worried at all.</p>

    <p>The second minister was worried as his half of his food was rotten and
      wouldn't last him for the entire duration of his imprisonment.</p>

    <p>The third minister was terrified as he had no food at all. He was
      neglectful and lazy in carrying out the command of the king.</p>

    <p>Moral of the story:</p>

    <p>Each one of us is like one of the ministers above. We have all been given
      a book which we need to fill with good deeds for use in the hereafter.
      Some of us will be sincere and will collect plenty of good deeds. Others
      will live like the remaining two ministers who will have a mixture of good
      and bad deeds while some will totally neglect their duty and waste their
      life by committing sins day and night. On the day of judgment, we will be
      responsible for what we have done. Let's be like the first minister who
      took things seriously and had nothing to worry about in the end.</p>

    <h2>Backbiting and the Dead Donkey</h2><a
      name="backbiting_and_the_dead_donkey"></a>

    <p>Once two people were backbiting about a person who had committed
      adultery.  Prophet Muhammad (saw) heard their conversation and kept on
      walking quietly.  After a while, they came across a dead carcass of a
      donkey with scattered legs. Rasoolallah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said
      to them, "Go and eat the flesh of this dead donkey." They said, "How can
      the flesh of a dead donkey be eaten?" Rasoolallah (Sallallahu Alaihi
      Wasallam) said, "You insulted your brother, which is worse than eating the
      flesh of a dead donkey."</p>

    <p>The above incident has been extracted from a hadith narrated by Abu
      Dawud.</p>

    <p>We learn from this incident that the foul effect of backbiting is even
      worse than eating the meat of a dead rotten animal. Backbiting is sweet to
      the tongue but it is similar to smoking. The smoker enjoys when he is
      smoking but at the same time, he is destroying his lungs. In the same
      manner, when a person backbites, he/she is destroying their own good deeds
      by giving them away to the person they are talking about.</p>

    <p>Moreover, if someone backbites a lot, do not trust them with your
      secrets.  That's because, if they can talk about other people without any
      hesitation, they can certainly talk about you with others.</p>

    <h2>Judging too Quickly</h2><a name="judging_too_quickly"></a>

    <p>A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train's window shouted...</p>

    <p>"Dad, look the trees are going behind us!"</p>

    <p>As his Dad smiled, a couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old's
      childish behavior with pity, when suddenly he again exclaimed...</p>

    <p>"Dad, look the clouds are running with us!"</p>

    <p>The couple couldn't resist and said to the old man...</p>

    <p>"Why don't you take your son to see a good doctor?"</p>

    <p>The old man smiled and said...</p>

    <p>"I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from
      birth and he just got his eyes today."</p>

    <h2>The Dirty Laundry</h2><a name="the_dirty_laundry"></a>

    <p>A young couple moves into a new neighborhood. The next morning while they are
      eating breakfast, the young woman sees her neighbour hanging the laundry
      outside. "That laundry is not very clean", she said. "She doesn't know how to
      wash correctly. Perhaps she needs better laundry soap. "Her husband looked on,
      but remained silent. Every time her neighbour would hang her washing to dry,
      the young woman would make the same comments.</p>

    <p>About one month later, the woman was surprised to see a nice clean laundry on
      the line and said to her husband: "Look, she has learned how to wash
      correctly. I wonder who taught her this."</p>

    <p>"The husband said, "I got up early this morning and cleaned our windows".</p>

    <p>Lesson: If our windows are dirty so will we see others as dirty too. What we
      see in others is indeed a reflection of our inner-selves. So it is with life
      that what we see when watching others depends on the purity of the window
      through which we look. It is easy for us to discuss other people, their lives
      &amp; things that really doesn't even concern us and we tend to forget - our
      windows may not be that clean after all! If we are good we will see
      good.</p>

    <p>In life we often tend to be judgmental and very often look down upon others
      without exploring deeper as to why the person is behaving in such a way.</p>

    <p>The Beloved Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) is reported to have said:
      <q>A Muslim is a mirror to another Muslim.</q> <cite>(Abu Dawud)</cite></p>

    <h2>The Pious "Drunkard" and "Fornicator"</h2><a
      name="the_pious_drunkard_and_fornicator"></a>

    <p>Sultan Murad IV, the Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1623-1640, would
      often anonymously go into the midst of the people and see their state. One
      evening, he felt an uneasiness in himself and the urge to go out. He
      called for his head of security and out they went. They came to a busy
      vicinity, and found a man lying on the ground. The Sultan prodded him but
      he was dead and the people were going about their own business. Nobody
      seemed to care about the dead man lying on the ground.</p>

    <p>The Sultan called upon the people. They didn't recognise him and asked
      him what he wanted. He said, "Why is this man lying dead on the ground and
      why does no one seem to care? Where is his family?"</p>

    <p>They replied, "He is so and so, the drunkard and fornicator!"</p>

    <p>The Sultan said, "Is he not from the Ummah of Muhammad (saw)? Now help me
      carry him to his house."</p>

    <p>The people carried the dead man with the Sultan to his house and once
      they reached, they all left. The Sultan and his assistant remained. When
      the man's wife saw his dead body, she began weeping. She said to his dead
      body, "May Allah have mercy on you! O friend of Allah! I bear witness that
      you are from the pious ones."</p>

    <p>The Sultan was bewildered. He said, "How is he from the pious ones when
      the people say such and such about him? So much so that no one even cared
      he was dead!"</p>

    <p>She replied, "I was expecting that. My husband would go to the tavern
      every night and buy as much wine as he could. He would then bring it home
      and pour it all down the drain. He would then say, 'I saved the Muslims a
      little today.' He would then go to a prostitute, give her some money and
      tell her to close her door till the morning. He would then return home for
      a second time and say, 'Today, I saved a young woman and the youth of the
      believers from vice.'"</p>

    <p>The people would see him buying wine and they would see him going to the
      prostitutes and they would consequently talk about him. One day I said to
      him, "When you die, there will be no one to bathe you, there will be no
      one to pray over you and there will be no one to bury you!"</p>

    <p>He laughed and replied, "Don't fear, the Sultan of the believers, along
      with the pious ones shall pray over my body."</p>

    <p>The Sultan began to cry. He said, "By Allah! He has said the truth, for I
      am Sultan Murad. Tomorrow we shall bathe him, pray over him and bury
      him."</p>

    <p>And it so happened that the Sultan, the scholars, the pious people and
      the masses prayed over him.</p>

    <p>We judge people by what we see and what we hear from others. Only if we
      were to see what was concealed in their hearts, a secret between them and
      their Lord. If Allah knows, why does it matter who knows and who doesn't
      know?!</p>

    <p><q>O you who believe, abstain from many of the suspicions. Some suspicions
      are sins. And do not be curious (to find out faults of others), and do not
      backbite one another. Does one of you like that he eats the flesh of his
      dead brother? You would abhor it. And fear Allah. Surely Allah is
      Most-Relenting, Very-Merciful.</q> <cite>(49:12)</cite></p>

    <h2>The King and the Poor Man</h2><a name="the_king_and_the_poor_man"></a>

    <p>There was a king who decided to take a tour of his country. As he passed
      by different places, everyone rushed to see him. However, while passing by
      a certain place, he noticed a poor old man who did not pay any attention
      to the king's arrival and remained engaged in his own activities. The king
      went up to this poor man and asked why he did not join the people to see
      him. The poor man replied, "Before you, there was another king who once
      passed by this place. Everyone gathered to see him as well. But, few days
      later he died and was buried in a place nearby. A poor man also died
      during that time and was buried near the king's grave. After some time, a
      strong flood passed through that area causing those graves to overturn. As
      a result, the bones of the poor man became mixed up with those of the
      king's. We could not differentiate between them any longer. After seeing
      this, it does not matter to me anymore as to who is a king and who is a
      beggar. In the end, our home is the same."</p>

    <p>Narrated by brother Ayyub from Toronto, Canada during one of his
      lectures.</p>

    <h2>Enemy Becomes a Friend</h2><a name="enemy_becomes_a_friend"></a>

    <p>In the sixth year after the hijrah, the Prophet, peace be upon him,
      decided to expand the scope of his mission. He sent eight letters to
      rulers in the Arabian peninsula and surrounding areas inviting them to
      Islam. One of these rulers was Thumamah ibn Uthal.</p>

    <p>Thumamah was one of the most powerful Arab rulers in pre-Qur'anic times.
      This is not surprising since he was a chieftain of the Banu Hanifah and
      one of the rulers of al- Yamamah whose word no one dared to challenge or
      disobey.</p>

    <p>When Thumamah received the Prophet's letter, he was consumed by anger and
      rejected it. He refused to listen to the invitation of Truth and goodness.
      More than that, he felt a strong desire to go and kill the Prophet and
      bury his mission with him.</p>

    <p>Thumamah waited and waited for a convenient time to carry out his design
      against the Prophet until eventually forgetfulness caused him to lose
      interest. One of his uncles, however, reminded him of his plan, praising
      what he intended to do.</p>

    <p>In the pursuit of his evil design against the Prophet, Thumamah met and
      killed a group of the Prophet's companions. The Prophet thereupon declared
      him a wanted man who could lawfully be killed on sight.</p>

    <p>Not long afterwards, Thumamah decided to perform umrah. He wanted to
      perform tawaf around the Ka'bah and sacrifice to the idols there (The
      people of Makkah, before becoming Muslims, placed hundreds of idols in the
      Holy Ka'bah. These idols were later destroyed by the Prophet). So he left
      al-Yamamah for Makkah. As he was passing near Madinah, an incident took
      place which he had not anticipated.</p>

    <p>Groups of Muslims were patrolling the districts of Madinah and outlying
      areas on the lookout for any strangers or anyone intent on causing
      trouble. One of these groups came upon Thumamah and apprehended him but
      they did not know who he was. They took him to Madinah and tied him to one
      of the columns in the mosque. They waited for the Prophet himself to
      question the man and decide what should be done with him.</p>

    <p>When the Prophet was about to enter the mosque, he saw Thumamah and asked
      his companions, "Do you know whom you have taken?"</p>

    <p>"No, messenger of God," they replied.</p>

    <p>"This is Thumamah ibn Uthal al-Hanafi," he said. "You have done well in
      capturing him."</p>

    <p>The Prophet then returned home to his family and said, "Get what food you
      can and send it to Thumamah ibn Uthal." He then ordered his camel to be
      milked for him. All this was done before he met Thumamah or had spoken to
      him.</p>

    <p>The Prophet then approached Thumamah hoping to encourage him to become a
      Muslim. "What do you have to say for yourself" he asked.</p>

    <p>"If you want to kill in reprisal," Thumamah replied, "you can have
      someone of noble blood to kill. If, out of your bounty, you want to
      forgive, I shall be grateful. If you want money in compensation, I shall
      give you whatever amount you ask."</p>

    <p>The Prophet then left him for two days, but still personally sent him
      food and drink and milk from his camel. The Prophet went back to him and
      asked, "What do you have to say for yourself" Thumamah repeated what he
      had said the day before. The Prophet then left and came back to him the
      following day. "What do you have to say for yourself?" he asked again and
      Thumamah repeated what he had said once more. Then the Prophet turned to
      his companions and said, "Set him free."</p>

    <p>Thumamah left the mosque of the Prophet and rode until he came to a palm
      grove on the outskirts of Madinah near al-Baqi' (a place of luxuriant
      vegetation which later became a cemetery for many of the Prophet's
      companions). He watered his camel and washed himself well. Then he turned
      back and made his way to the Prophet's mosque. There, he stood before a
      congregation of Muslims and said:</p>

    <p>"I bear witness that there is no god but Allah and I bear witness that
      Muhammad is His servant and His messenger." He then went to the Prophet,
      upon whom be peace, and said:</p>

    <p>"O Muhammad, by God, there was never on this earth a face more detestable
      than yours. Now, yours is the dearest face of all to me."</p>

    <p>"I have killed some of your men," he continued, "I am at your mercy. What
      will you have done to me?"</p>

    <p>"There is now no blame on you, Thumamah," replied the Prophet. "Becoming
      a Muslim obliterates past actions and marks a new beginning."</p>

    <h2>A True Muslim Leader</h2><a name="a_true_muslim_leader"></a>

    <p>Once Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho Anho), during his caliphate, was going on
      his usual rounds towards Harrah (a suburb of Madinah) with his slave
      Aslam, when he saw a distant fire in the desert. He said, "There seems to
      be a camp. Perhaps, it is a caravan that could not enter the town due to
      night fall. Let's go and look after them and arrange for their protection
      during the night."</p>

    <p>When he reached there, he found a woman and some children. The children
      were crying. The woman had a pan of water over the fire. Hadhrat Umar
      (Radhiyallaho Anho) greeted her with salaam and, with her permission, went
      near her. (The woman didn't recognize that it was Umar).</p>

    <p>Umar, "Why are these children crying?"</p>

    <p>The Woman, "Because they are hungry."</p>

    <p>Umar, "What is in the pan?"</p>

    <p>The Woman, "Only water to soothe the children, so that they may go to
      sleep in the belief that food is being prepared for them. Ah! Allah will
      judge between Umar (Radhiyallaho Anho) and me, on the Day of Judgment, for
      neglecting me in my distress."</p>

    <p>Umar (weeping), "May Allah have mercy on you! How can Umar know of your
      distress?"</p>

    <p>The Woman, "When he is our Amir, he must keep himself informed about
      us."</p>

    <p>Hadhrat Umar (Radhiyallaho Anho) returned to the town and straight away
      went to the Baitul Mal (House of Charity) to fill a sack with flour,
      dates, fat, and clothes, and also drew some money. When the sack was
      ready, he said to Aslam, "Now put this sack on my back, Aslam."</p>

    <p>Aslam, "No please, Amir-ul-Momineen! I shall carry this sack."</p>

    <p>Umar refused to listen to Aslam, even on his persistent requests to allow
      him to carry the sack, and remarked, "What! Will you carry my load on the
      Day of Judgment? I must carry this bag, for it is I who would be
      questioned (in the Hereafter) about this woman."</p>

    <p>Aslam most reluctantly placed the bag on Umar's (Radhiyallaho Anho) back,
      who carried it with a swift pace right to the woman's tent. Aslam followed
      at his heels. He put a little flour and some dates and fat in the pan and
      began to stir. He blew (with his mouth) into the fire to kindle it.</p>

    <p>Aslam says, "I saw the smoke passing through his thick beard."</p>

    <p>After some time, the pottage was ready. He himself served it to the
      family. When they had eaten to their fill, he made over to them the little
      that was left for their next meal. The children were very happy after
      their meal and began to play about merrily.</p>

    <p>The woman felt very grateful and remarked, "May Allah reward you for your
      kindness! In fact you deserve to take the place of Khalifah instead of
      Umar."</p>

    <p>Umar consoled her and said, "When you come to see the Khalifah, you will
      find me there."</p>

    <p>He sat for a while at a place close by and kept on watching the children.
      He then returned to Madinah. On his way back, he said to Aslam, "Do you
      know why I sat there, Aslam? I had seen them weeping in distress. I liked
      to see them laughing and happy for some time."</p>

    <h2>Dry Bread and Vinegar</h2><a name="dry_bread_and_vinegar"></a>

    <p>Hadrath Ibn Abbas narrates: Holy Prophet (SAW) asked Umm Hani if there
      was anything to eat. Umm Hani (RA) said that there was only dry bread and
      she felt ashamed of offering it to him. He said: "No! Bring it." He broke
      the bread into pieces, dipped them into water and added some salt. Then he
      asked her if there was any curry. She said there was nothing except
      vinegar. He sent for it and then, sprinkling it over the crumbs, ate them
      and thanked Allah. Source: Baihaqi.</p>

    <p>Allahu Akbar! How thankful our Prophet was to Allah even after getting
      such type of food. We now a days throw away better food than this.</p>

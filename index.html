<h2>Truthfulness of a Young Boy</h2><a name="truthfulness_of_a_young_boy"></a>

<p>Abdul Qadir Jilani was an eminent Islamic scholar born in 11th Century CE,
  Persia.<p>

<p>Early stories of Abdul Qadir Jilani describe him as a youth with a strong
  inclination for learning with a pious mother who encouraged her son to acquire
  knowledge. The following incident is narrated in a number of biographies of
  Abdul Qadir Jilani.</p>

<p>At the age of eighteen he asked permission from his mother to travel to
  Baghdad to pursue his education. Baghdad then was the hub of political,
  commercial and cultural activity, and the center of world learning.</p>

<p>On hearing this his mother was more than happy to send her son off to follow
  the path of higher scholarship. It was for such a purpose she had saved forty
  gold coins for Abdul Qadir. As she prepared supplies for his journey she sewed
  the coins into the lining of his coat for safekeeping.</p>

<p>Before Abdul Qadir joined the caravan to travel to Baghdad, her parting
  advice to her son was, "Whenever you speak, speak the truth. Remember that the
  Prophet Muhammad (pbuh) said, <q>Truthfulness leads to righteousness and
  righteousness leads to Paradise...</q> and the Quran tells us <q>O you who believe!
  Be careful of your duty to God, and be with the truthful.</q> <cite>(Quran
  9:119)</cite>"</p>

<p>In route to Baghdad the caravan was assaulted by a band of robbers. As the
  thugs began to extract all the valuables from the travelers, one of the
  robbers started to search Abdul Qadir's belongings.</p>

<p>While searching, the robber asked Abdul Qadir, "Do you have anything
  valuable?'</p>

<p>Abdul Qadir calmly replied, "Yes."</p>

<p>On hearing this the robber franticly searched further but could not find
  anything.</p>

<p>The robber took Abdul Qadir to his leader and said, "This boy says he has
  valuables but I cannot find anything on him."</p>

<p>The leader of the robbers asked Abdul Qadir, "Are you hiding any
  valuables?"</p>

<p>Again Abdul Qadir answered, "Yes."</p>

<p>The robber asked, "What are you hiding?"</p>

<p>Abdul Qadir replied, "Forty Gold Coins."</p>

<p>Upon further searching the robber discovered the coins hidden in the lining
  of Abdul Qadir's coat.</p>

<p>Among all the chaos and panic stricken travelers Abdul Qadir's unfrazzled
  demeanor and admitting the valuables he was hiding was perplexing to the
  robber.</p>

<p>The robber was now curious to know more about this boy who was not afraid and
  insisted on speaking the truth.</p>

<p>The robber asked, "What is your name and where do you come from?"</p>

<p>He got a reply, "My name is Abdul Qadir and I come from the province of Jilan
  in Persia."</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>"I am going to Baghdad."</p>

<p>"What do you plan to do in Baghdad?"</p>

<p>"I want to study with the greatest scholars to gain knowledge."</p>

<p>"Why didn't you hide the truth and keep your gold coins safe from us?"</p>

<p>Abdul Qadir related the advice his mother gave him and the directive of the
  Prophet and the Quran to always speak the truth.</p>

<p>On hearing this the robber was overcome with remorse and exclaimed to his
  companions, "This young boy is fearless and has an unshakable faith in God. He
  has the courage to stand up against people like us. Indeed his mother has
  taught him wisely and he is a true example of being a Muslim."</p>

<p>Holding his head in shame, tears started to roll down his face. He embraced
  Abdul Qadir and asked for his forgiveness.</p>

<p>Abdul Qadir responded, "You only need to pray to God and ask for forgiveness
  and guidance. God willing you will amend your ways."</p>

<p>On hearing this the leader of the robbers told his henchmen to return
  everything that was taken from the travelers. Then he cried out, "O God this
  young boy has shown us the straight path. Please forgive us and guide us to
  the right way."</p>

<p>This is how a simple moral value of truthfulness thought by a mother to a
  young boy affected a band of robbers to change their lives.</p>

<p>Abdul Qadir Jilani went on to become a great scholar and teacher of Islamic
  jurisprudence.</p>

<p>By Majd Arbil. The story is originally told in the book of Irsyadul 'Ibad by
  Shaykh Zainuddin bin Abdul' Aziz al-Malibari, quoting the story of al-Yafi'i,
  from Abu Abdillah Muhammad bin Muqatil, from Sheikh Abdul Qadir al-Jailani.

<h2>The King and Ministers with Three Bags</h2><a
  name="the_king_and_ministers_with_three_bags"></a>

<p>Once a king called three of his most important ministers and gave each one of
  them a bag. He then told them to go around and fill up the bags with fruits.
  This would test the sincerity of his ministers.</p>

<p>The first minister took the order of the king seriously and worked hard to
  collect the best fruits he could find and filled up his bag.</p>

<p>The second minister took the order of the king lightly and filled up his bag
  with a mixture of good and rotten fruits.</p>

<p>The third minister did the totally opposite of both ministers. He filled up
  the bag with just dry leaves and dirt. His intention was to fool the king by
  just giving an impression that he had done his job filling the bag. He didn't
  have a single fruit in his bag.</p>

<p>All three ministers came back to the court of the king with their bags.
  Without inquiring what they had collected, the king ordered that each minister
  must be sent to a separate jail for three months. The food they will be eating
  is what they had each collected in their bags.</p>

<p>The first minister was happy as he had plenty of good quality food to live
  on. He wasn't worried at all.</p>

<p>The second minister was worried as his half of his food was rotten and
  wouldn't last him for the entire duration of his imprisonment.</p>

<p>The third minister was terrified as he had no food at all. He was neglectful
  and lazy in carrying out the command of the king.</p>

<p>Moral of the story:</p>

<p>Each one of us is like one of the ministers above. We have all been given a
  book which we need to fill with good deeds for use in the hereafter. Some of
  us will be sincere and will collect plenty of good deeds. Others will live
  like the remaining two ministers who will have a mixture of good and bad deeds
  while some will totally neglect their duty and waste their life by committing
  sins day and night. On the day of judgment, we will be responsible for what we
  have done. Let's be like the first minister who took things seriously and had
  nothing to worry about in the end.</p>

<h2>A Mother's Inspirational Advice to Her Deformed Son</h2><a
  name="a_mothers_inspirational_advice_to_her_deformed_son"></a>

<p>Muhammad ibn Abdur-rahman al-Awqas was born a physical deformity. His neck
  used to be inside his body and his shoulders used to protrude as if they were
  two spears.</p>

<p>His mother, realizing that his appearance may attract ridicule from others,
  said to him: O my son, you will not be with the people except that you will be
  one who is laughed at and mocked. So upon you is to seek knowledge, for verily
  it will raise you. So he sought knowledge.</p>

<p>Muhammad ibn Abdur-rahman al-Awqas listened to his mother's advice and was
  diligent in seeking knowledge. He worked hard and was appointed as a judge of
  Makkah for twenty years. People looked up to him due to his knowledge and
  disregarded his physical appearance.</p>

<p>Source: Extracted from the narration of Khateeb al-Baghdaadi in Faqih
  wal-Mutafaqqih (no. 119) and graded Saheeh by the verifier of the book 'Adil
  al-'Azaazi (1/141)</p>

<h2>Potatoes, Eggs and Coffee Beans</h2><a
  name="potatoes_eggs_and_coffee_beans"></a>

<p>Once upon a time a daughter complained to her father that her life was
  miserable and that she didn't know how she was going to make it. She was tired
  of fighting and struggling all the time. It seemed just as one problem was
  solved, another one soon followed.</p>

<p>Her father, a chef, took her to the kitchen. He filled three pots with water
  and placed each on a high fire. Once the three pots began to boil, he placed
  potatoes in one pot, eggs in the second pot and ground coffee beans in the
  third pot. He then let them sit and boil without saying a word to his
  daughter. The daughter moaned and impatiently waited, wondering what he was
  doing. After twenty minutes he turned off the burners. He took the potatoes
  out of the pot and placed them in a bowl. He took the eggs out and placed them
  in a bowl. He then ladled the coffee out and placed it in a cup.</p>

<p>Turning to her, he asked. "What do you see?" "Potatoes, eggs and coffee," she
  hastily replied.</p>

<p>"Look closer", he said, "and touch the potatoes." She did and noted that they
  were soft.</p>

<p>He then asked her to take an egg and break it. After pulling off the shell,
  she observed the hard-boiled egg.</p>

<p>Finally, he asked her to sip the coffee. Its rich aroma brought a smile to
  her face.</p>

<p>"Father, what does this mean?" she asked.</p>

<p>He explained that the potatoes, the eggs and coffee beans had each faced the
  same adversity - the boiling water. However, each one reacted differently.</p>

<p>The potato went in strong, hard and unrelenting, but in boiling water, it
  became soft and weak. The egg was fragile, with the thin outer shell
  protecting its liquid interior until it was put in the boiling water. Then the
  inside of the egg became hard. However, the ground coffee beans were unique.
  After they were exposed to the boiling water, they changed the water and
  created something new.</p>

<h2>Backbiting and the Dead Donkey</h2><a
  name="backbiting_and_the_dead_donkey"></a>

<p>Once two people were backbiting about a person who had committed adultery.
  Prophet Muhammad (saw) heard their conversation and kept on walking quietly.
  After a while, they came across a dead carcass of a donkey with scattered
  legs. Rasoolallah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said to them, "Go and eat the
  flesh of this dead donkey." They said, "How can the flesh of a dead donkey be
  eaten?" Rasoolallah (Sallallahu Alaihi Wasallam) said, "You insulted your
  brother, which is worse than eating the flesh of a dead donkey."</p>

<p>The above incident has been extracted from a hadith narrated by Abu
  Dawud.</p>

<p>We learn from this incident that the foul effect of backbiting is even worse
  than eating the meat of a dead rotten animal. Backbiting is sweet to the
  tongue but it is similar to smoking. The smoker enjoys when he is smoking but
  at the same time, he is destroying his lungs. In the same manner, when a
  person backbites, he/she is destroying their own good deeds by giving them
  away to the person they are talking about.</p>

<p>Moreover, if someone backbites a lot, do not trust them with your secrets.
  That's because, if they can talk about other people without any hesitation,
  they can certainly talk about you with others.</p>

<h2>Judging too Quickly</h2><a name="judging_too_quickly"></a>

<p>A 24 year old boy seeing out from the train's window shouted...</p>

<p>"Dad, look the trees are going behind us!"</p>

<p>As his Dad smiled, a couple sitting nearby, looked at the 24 year old's
  childish behavior with pity, when suddenly he again exclaimed...</p>

<p>"Dad, look the clouds are running with us!"</p>

<p>The couple couldn't resist and said to the old man...</p>

<p>"Why don't you take your son to see a good doctor?"</p>

<p>The old man smiled and said...</p>

<p>"I did and we are just coming from the hospital, my son was blind from birth
  and he just got his eyes today."</p>
